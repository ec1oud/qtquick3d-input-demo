This is a demo of a new feature in Qt 6.1: you could already map a Qt Quick
sub-scene onto a 3D object, but now the interactive features work: you can
click buttons, detect hover, edit text and so on.

Also a demo of an experimental feature that isn't integrated yet: Pointer
Handlers on 3D Models, for clicking 3D buttons and such.

There's also a
